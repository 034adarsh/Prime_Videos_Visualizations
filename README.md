Welcome to the Prime Video Data Exploration project! This project dives into the world of Amazon Prime Video's vast content library, providing insightful visualizations and analysis of trends, genres, ratings, and more.

## üìë Project Overview

In this project, we analyze Amazon Prime Video‚Äôs content distribution across various dimensions such as release year, genres, ratings, and type (movies vs TV shows). The goal is to extract meaningful insights and trends through exploratory data analysis (EDA), using interactive visualizations.

## üìö Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following libraries:
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for static visualizations
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Sections

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**  
   The dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and dropping duplicates, ensuring smooth analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   We explored the dataset through a series of visualizations:

   - **Distribution of Content by Release Year**  
     Maximum content was released in 2021, likely due to increased OTT consumption during the pandemic. Over the years, Prime Video has consistently increased its content library, with a noticeable spike in 2021.

   - **Prime Video Genre Distribution (Top 10 Genres)**  
     - **Pie Chart**: Drama (12.1%) leads, followed by Action (9.05%) and Comedy (8.06%). This chart gives us a clear visual representation of the genre distribution.
     - **Bar Chart**: Drama has over 2,000 titles, followed by Action and Comedy. This chart highlights the sheer volume of content in each genre.
     
     From these two charts, we learn that while the bar chart shows volume, the pie chart gives a more digestible overview of content distribution by genre.

   - **Prime Video Content Distribution by Rating**  
     The majority of content is rated **13+**, making it suitable for teenagers and families. This insight highlights that Prime Video caters largely to a broad audience base, with minimal content rated for children or more mature audiences.

   - **Prime Video Content Distribution: Movies vs TV Shows**  
     Prime Video's content is dominated by movies, which make up 80.8% of the platform‚Äôs offerings, while TV shows account for 19.2%. This highlights Prime Video‚Äôs focus on feature-length content.

## üìà Visualizations

Interactive visualizations with Plotly make this project engaging, allowing users to hover over elements, filter data, and explore insights in an intuitive manner.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project explored the vast content library of Amazon Prime Video, uncovering valuable insights about release trends, genres, ratings, and content types. Through this analysis, we have seen the growing influence of streaming platforms and the broad diversity of content on Prime Video.

We hope you find these insights interesting and useful!
